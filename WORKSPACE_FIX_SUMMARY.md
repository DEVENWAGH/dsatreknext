## Database Schema Dependencies

The workspace requires these tables:
- `problems` - Problem data with test cases
- `submissions` - User submission records
- `users` - User authentication data

## Next Steps

1. Test the workspace with a sample problem
2. Verify Judge0 integration is working
3. Check database submissions are being saved
4. Test premium problem access control
5. Verify real-time collaboration features
